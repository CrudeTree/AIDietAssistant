## Summary
AIDietAssistant helps you log foods/meals and chat with an AI assistant. To provide these features, the app collects and processes certain data described below.

## What data we collect
- **Account info**: Email address and password (handled by Firebase Authentication).
- **Profile info**: Name, weight, weight goal, diet type, fasting preferences.
- **App content you provide**:
  - Chat messages you send and AI responses.
  - Food/meal entries you add by text.
  - Photos you capture/upload for foods/meals (product front, ingredients, nutrition facts, meal photos).
- **Diagnostics**: Basic app performance/crash data (if enabled via Firebase services).

## How we use your data
- **Provide core features**: show your history, food list, and personalized AI responses.
- **AI analysis**: When you submit text or photos for analysis, the app sends the content to our backend proxy, which forwards it to an AI model for analysis and response generation.
- **Security and abuse prevention**: We may enforce request limits and require authentication.

## Where your data is stored
- **Firebase (Google)**:
  - **Authentication** for login.
  - **Firestore** for app data (profile, food items, chat messages).
  - **Cloud Storage** for uploaded images (when enabled/used).
  - **Cloud Functions** for the AI proxy endpoint.

## Third-party processing (AI)
When you use AI features, your submitted text and/or images are processed by an AI provider via our proxy. We do not sell your personal data.

## Data retention
We keep your data while your account is active so the app can function. You can remove items within the app (where supported). If you want your account and associated data deleted, contact us (see below).

## Your choices
- You can choose not to upload photos and use text-only entry.
- You can delete food items you added (where supported by the UI).

## Children’s privacy
This app is not intended for children.
